Geometry

spacetime
.stage
.cause on physical phenomenon (e.g. gravity)
Einstein reconsiders this issue, regards spacetime as an original driver.

Main point of relativity theories: to remove incorrect and simplify the assumptions about the nature of spacetime.
replace Euclidean space with differrentiable maifold

*affine connection (parrallelism)
*metric (length)

Gravity emerges as natural consequence of curvature of spacetime.


The special theory

Newton's law (1686)

For on body & acceleration of abserver seemingly indistinguishable.

Eddington's parody 

From the beauty of Maxwell's EM theory and thought experiment, Einsten believes the speed of light is constant
