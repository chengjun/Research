We developed tools to pull data from Sina Weibo, Twitter and Facebook, as well as blogs and HK forums.

Since the second part of 2011, the Sina Weibo tools are Python scripts that leverage the librairies provided by Sina (weibopy) to access their API through OAuth2.

twitter.oauth.py and facebook.oauth.py perform various pull operations from Twitter and Facebook. The OAuth token and secret, Facebook ID, should be in your version of mypass.py. Usage information is generally available when running the script. facebook.search.py is used for searching (a way of discovering new contents by keyword search).

twitter_pull.sql and facebook_pull.sql should create the postgresql databases needed to store the data of these aforementioned scripts.

In late November 2011, we added scripts to fetch data from the Google+ and the QQ Weibo API. The database schema are available in their respective sub-directories.

These scripts are developed under Linux (Ubuntu Lucid 10.04). I used Python 2.6.5 and my version of Postgresql is 8.4 (with Postgis 1.5).
