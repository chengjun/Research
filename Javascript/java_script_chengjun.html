<p>A woman and man get into a car accident. Both of their cars are totally demolished, but amazingly neither one of them is hurt.</p>

<p>After they crawl out of the wreckage, the woman says, "Wow, look at our cars -- there's nothing left! This must be a sign from Him that we should be friends and not try to pin the blame on each other."</p>

<p>The man replies, "Oh yes, I agree with you completely."</p>

<p>The woman points to a bottle on the ground and says, "Somehow this bottle of Scotch from my back seat didn't break. Surely God wants us to drink this Scotch and celebrate our good fortune."</p>

<p>She hands the bottle to the man. The man nods his head in agreement, opens it, and chugs about a third of the bottle to calm his nerves. The woman takes the bottle, immediately puts the cap back on, and hands it back to the man.</p>

<p>The man asks, "Aren't you having any?"</p>

<p>The woman replies, "No. I think I'll just wait for the police."</p>
